# Crosslinks
## Introduction

This MODX Extra adds a custom manager page that allows you to create and
maintain a list of crosslinks inside of your site. Entries into the crosslinks
take the form of `text => resource` where `text` is the linktext and `resource`
is the linked resource. A plugin replaces each linktext on a modx resource with
the crosslink.

For more information please read the [documentation](http://jako.github.io/Crosslinks/).
