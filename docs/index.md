# Crosslinks

Manage crosslinks inside of your site. This MODX Extra adds a custom manager
page that allows you to create and maintain a list of crosslinks. Each entry of
the crosslinks list take the form of `text => resource` where `text` is the
searched linktext and `resource` is the linked resource. A plugin replaces each
linktext on a modx resource with the crosslink.

### Requirements

* MODX Revolution 2.6+
* PHP v5.6+

### Features

* Custom Manager Page for managing the crosslinks
* Plugin for replacing the linktexts with the crosslinks in a MODX resource
