# Crosslinks

This MODX Extra adds a custom manager page that allows you to create and
maintain a list of crosslinks inside of your site. Entries into the crosslinks
take the form of `text => resource` where `text` is the linktext and `resource`
is the linked resource. A plugin replaces each linktext on a modx resource with
the crosslink.

### Requirements

- MODX Revolution 2.6+
- PHP v5.4+

### Features

- Custom Manager Page for maintaining the crosslinks
- Plugin for replacing the linktexts with the crosslinks in a MODX resource
