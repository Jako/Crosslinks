In the MODX Manager, navigate to the Package Manager page, and select 'Search locally for packages' from the dropdown button. Crosslinks should now show up in the list of available packages. Click the corresponding 'Install' button and follow instructions to complete the installation. Build it from source To build and install the package from source you could use Git Package Management . The GitHub repository of Crosslinks contains a config.json to build that package locally. Use this option, if you want to debug Crosslinks and/or contribute bugfixes and enhancements. If you want to run the unit tests, you have to rename the file test/properties.sample.inc.php to test/properties.inc.php and change the values in that file (if needed).","title":"Installation"},{"location":"installation/#install-from-modx-extras","text":"Search for Crosslinks in the Package Manager of a MODX installation and install it in there.","title":"Install from MODX Extras"},{"location":"installation/#manual-installation","text":"If you can't access the MODX Extras Repository in your MODX installation, you can manually install Crosslinks.
