# Crosslinks
## Introduction

This MODX Extra adds a custom manager page that allows you to create & maintain 
a list of explanations for key terms in your site. Entries into the crosslinks 
take the form of `term => explanation` where `term` is the phrase being 
described and `explanation` is the description of said term.

For more information please read the [documentation](http://jako.github.io/Crosslinks/).
