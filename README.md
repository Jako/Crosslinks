# Crosslinks

Manage crosslinks inside of your site.

## Features

This MODX Extra adds a custom manager page that allows you to create and
maintain a list of crosslinks. Each entry of the crosslinks list take the form
of `text => resource` where `text` is the searched linktext and `resource` is
the linked resource. A plugin replaces each linktext on a MODX resource with a
crosslink.

## Installation

## Usage

Install via package manager and create the crosslinks in the custom manager page.
